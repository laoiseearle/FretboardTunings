# Branch Info

This is a Work In Progress branch for a new design I am currently working on. I have decided to recreate this project using React in order to create a more interactive fretboard. Once the new design is complete the project name will be changed from fretboard-tunings to fretfinder.

## Planned Features

- Touchscreens will be able to change the pitch direction by clicking on the pitch-direction icon inside the header.
- Delete/add strings option.
- Instrument presets such as Guitar, Bass, Ukulele etc.
- Fretboard will be displayed vertically on smaller width devices, and horizontally on larger devices.
- Clicking on a note that isn't an open string will focus on all notes with the same pitch.

## Install

If you want to see the project at it's current state, you will need to make sure you have npm installed on your desktop and run the following commands in the terminal:

<b>1. Clone repo</b>
