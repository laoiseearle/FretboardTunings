# Fretboard Tunings
FretboardTunings is a JavaScript application built using the p5.js library which displays the fretboard notes of a guitar. The app allows you to modify the tuning by clicking on an open string to change the note, making it useful as a visual reference for finding notes and chords while using alternate Guitar tunings.
